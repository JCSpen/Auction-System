****NOTE THAT THE FULL CODE IS AVAILABLE UNDER JAMIE SPENCE INDIVIDUAK PROJECT, THE AUCTION SYSTEM FOLDER HOLDS THE PUBLISHED VERSION ONLY
An auction system model that was created in my first year of university.

This was made as a basic model to represent an auction system therefore it has limitations, note that the set database is viewable but cannot be altered without saving a copy. Each user will recieve their own copy on download, so no data is shared amongst users.
